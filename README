WELCOME TO THE GEMDAT WORKSHOP

Dear participants,

Welcome to our workshop on GEMDAT, an open-source project for analyzing Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Throughout this workshop, we will explore GEMDATâ€™s functionality using sample data we provide. If you already have simulation data from VASP, LAMMPS, or GROMACS, you are encouraged to bring it along and test GEMDAT with your own data.

REQUIREMENTS
- Python 3.10 or newer
- A working Python environment (virtualenv, conda, or similar)
- (Optional) Your own MD simulation data, if you wish to explore beyond our provided examples

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
Choose one of the following methods to install GEMDAT:

1) Using virtualenv

Create and activate a new virtual environment:
python3 -m venv env 
source env/bin/activate

Then install GEMDAT via pip:
python3 -m pip install gemdat

2) Using Conda

Create and activate a new conda environment:
conda create -n gemdat python=3.10 
conda activate gemdat

Then install GEMDAT via pip:
pip install gemdat

TROUBLESHOOTING
If you run into any issues, please contact the organizers during the workshop or email us.
